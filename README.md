# Kashmir Escapades PDF Generator

A React app to create PDF itineraries for Kashmir trips. This is my first project using the @react-pdf/renderer library!

## Features

- Download PDF itineraries with one click
- Clean, centered design with hover effects
- Shows loading state while generating PDF

## How It Works

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mateennazir/Pdf-generator.git


2. Install dependencies:

npm install
npm install @react-pdf/renderer


3. Run locally:

npm run dev

Visit http://localhost:3000 and click "Download Your Kashmir Itinerary"


Sample Look

Here's how it looks:

    A centered white card with a gradient background
    A blue button that lifts up on hover
    Text changes to "Preparing Your Itinerary..." while loading
